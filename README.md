# 👤 Face Recognition System

Welcome to my Face Recognition System project!  
This project is focused on building a real-time face recognition application using Python, OpenCV, and machine learning techniques. I’m currently working on it and have completed up to **Part 3: Face Detection/Recognition**. Stay tuned for updates!

## ✅ Project Status

- [x] Part 1: Generate dataset  
- [x] Part 2: Train the classifier and save it  
- [x] Part 3: Face detection/recognition  
- [ ] Part 4: Converting the project into GUI  
- [ ] Part 5: Connecting project to the database  
- [ ] Part 6 (Extra): GUI Face Recognition system using Tkinter Canvas  
- [ ] Part 7: Converting the project into a setup (Application) file

## 🎯 What Will You Learn?

- **Part 1:** How to generate a dataset using OpenCV by capturing images through a webcam  
- **Part 2:** How to train a face recognition model and save the trained classifier  
- **Part 3:** Detect and recognize faces in real-time using webcam feed  
- **Part 4:** Design a simple GUI to run the recognition system  
- **Part 5:** Connect recognized faces to a database (e.g., SQLite)  
- **Part 6 (Extra):** Use Tkinter Canvas to display face info and GUI controls  
- **Part 7:** Package the entire project into a standalone application (.exe)
